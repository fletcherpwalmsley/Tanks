A less than faithful recreation of the Wii Play mini-game **Tanks!** , designed for the Nintendo Wii.

Why recreate a game for a platform that it is originally from? Because I can!  
Wii Play Tanks! is a game I am rather fond of due to my childhood experiences playing it. As such, I have wanted to give a shot at remaking for some time. Creating it for the Wii will give me an extra challenge, but also makes the process a lot more fun.
