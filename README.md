# Tanks?

<img src="tank.png" width="120" align="left"/>
A less than faithful recreation of the Wii Play mini-game **Tanks!**, recreated for the Nintendo Wii.  
Why recreate a game for a platform that it is originally from? Because I can! 
Wii Play Tanks! is a game I am rather fond of from my childhood, and one that I have wanted to give a shot at remaking for some time.  
Creating it for the Wii gives me an extra challenge, but also makes the process a lot more fun.
