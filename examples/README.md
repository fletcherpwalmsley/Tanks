# Examples Readme

This directory holds "examples" that I have created to help me familiarise myself with `GRRLIB`, `box2d`, and the larger suite of tools provide by `devkitpro`.

These examples are rough, thrown together, and do not follow good coding practices.
Hopefully someone can find them useful as example code, but they should not be built on-top of.

The doc comment in each `main` file gives a brief overview of what that example is meant to showcase.
